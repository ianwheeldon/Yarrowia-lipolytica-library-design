# Yarrowia-lipolytica-library-design
The scripts presented here can be used for designing an n-fold coverage sgRNA library using CRISPR-Cas9 system for Yarrowia lipolytica, capable of targeting specific regions within each feature of the genome (i.e., gene, coding sequence, exon, etc.). These scripts can also be used to design sgRNA libraries for any organism of interest with a haploid genome.
